# jQuery Bootstrap Touch Keyboard (jQBTK)
This jQuery plugin using Bootstrap v3 to generate a popover keyboard for use on touchscreen devices. It was originally designed for use on large touchscreen computers used in a kiosk scenario, but would probably work elsewhere too.

Uses the Bootstrap popover component and dynamically adds buttons to form a keyboard, inserting the characters into the HTML input when pressed.

Requires jQuery and Bootstrap v3.

# Installation

1. Add Bootstrap CSS
2. Add jqbtk.min.css
3. Add jQuery
4. Add Bootstrap JS
5. Add jqbtk.min.js

# How to use

Refer to the documentation.html file for examples on usage. Or go to [www.matthewdawkins.co.uk/jqbtk](http://www.matthewdawkins.co.uk/jqbtk/) for documentation and working examples.

Note: since the keyboard listens for touch events, using this in a browser and clicking your mouse probably won't work. However, Chrome's Developer Tools has a 'device mode' that emulates touch events.
